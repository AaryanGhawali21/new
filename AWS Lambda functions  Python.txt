1]Go to Lambda
2]choose region north virgina default
3]create lambda function
4] function name = sum
   Runtime = python 3.8
   [lambda function created successfully]
5] write a code in it
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    first_num = 500
    second_num = 600
    sum = first_num + second_num
    return sum
6] then configure it by clicking on test ^ symbol
- create new event
- Event name = mytest
- and keep event Json code in it blank
{ 
}
save it and come out
7] click on deploy then
8]Then click on test

Second One


1] main code


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    if event["name"] == "aaryan":
        return "APSIT"
    else:
        return {
            "statusCode": 400,
            "body": "Name not matched"
        }

2] edit previous event 
3] json file write
   {
      "name" : "aaryan"
             }
4]save it and deploy it
5] output 


Exp11 (To understand AWS Lambda, its workflow, various functions and create
your first Lambda functions using Python / Java / Nodejs)

Here are the sequential steps for creating your first AWS Lambda function using
Python:
### Steps to Create Your First Lambda 


Function Using Python

1. Open AWS Console

- Search for the Lambda service and open the home screen of Lambda.

2. Choose Region
- Select the region in which you want to create the Lambda function (as it is
region-specific).

3. Create Lambda Function

- Name the function "sum."
- Select the latest version of Python as the runtime.
- Choose a role with basic Lambda permissions to allow CloudWatch for
monitoring.

4. Verify Creation
- Confirm that the Lambda "sum" function is created successfully.

5. Write Sample Python Code
- Implement the code for the sum of two numbers.

import json
def lambda_handler(event, context):
first_number = 100
second_number = 200
sum = first_number + second_number
return sum

6. Configure Test Event
- Create a test event in JSON format.

7. Write Second Sample Python Code

- Implement a second sample Python code that includes an if condition.

def lambda_handler (event, context):
if event["name"] == "vishal":
return "apsit"

8. Configure Test Event for Second Code
- Set up a test event for the second sample code, ensuring it returns a value as "apsit"
if conditions are met.

{
“name”: "Aaryan"
}
