Exp12 (To create a Lambda function which will log “An Image has been added”
once you add an object to a specific bucket in S3)

Steps to Use AWS Lambda with Amazon S3

1. Create S3 Bucket

○ Go to AWS Services and select S3 in the storage section.

○ Click "Create bucket" to store uploaded files.

○ Enter the Bucket name and select the Region.

○ Click the "Create" button.

○ Click the bucket name to upload files.



2. Create Role that Works with S3 and Lambda

○ Go to AWS Services and select IAM.
○ Click on "Roles" and then "Create role."
○ Choose the service that will use this role (select Lambda) and click
"Next: Permissions."
○ Add permissions: AmazonS3FullAccess, AWSLambdaFullAccess,
CloudWatchFullAccess, and click "Next: Tags."
○ Enter the Role name and description, then click "Create Role."

3. Create Lambda Function and Add S3 Trigger

○ Go to AWS Services and select Lambda.
○ Click "Create function," enter a name, choose the Runtime, and select
the Role.
○ Click "Create function."
○ Choose "Add trigger" and select S3.
○ Enter details, such as Prefix and File pattern (e.g., for .jpg files), then
click "Add."

○ Use the online editor to add code to handle S3 events.

exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    console.log("Incoming Event: ", event);
    const bucket = event.Records[0].s3.bucket.name;
    const filename = decodeURIComponent(event.Records[0].s3.object.key.replace(/\+/g,''));
    const message = `An Image has been added - ${bucket} -> ${filename}`;
    console.log(message);
    callback(null, message);
};


○ Save changes.

4. Test the Lambda Function

○ Open the S3 bucket created earlier.
○ Upload a file (e.g., an image) to the bucket.
○ To check the trigger details, go to AWS Services and select CloudWatch.
○ Open the logs for the Lambda function to see the output indicating the
file was uploaded
